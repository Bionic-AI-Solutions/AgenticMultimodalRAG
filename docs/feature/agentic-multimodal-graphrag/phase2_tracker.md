| Phase/Task                        | Description/Goal                                                      | Status        | Notes/PR |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------|
| 1. Vector Search API               | /query/vector endpoint, Milvus integration, multimodal (text/image/audio/PDF/video), MIME-based routing | âœ… Done        | All tests/documentation updated. Milestone achieved. |
| 2. GraphRAG Query API              | /query/graph endpoint, graph expansion (detailed Neo4j context/semantic) | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | Neo4j expansion implemented |
| 3. Direct Retrieval API            | /query/{doc_id} endpoint                                              | â¬œ Todo       |          |
| 4. Security & Multi-Tenancy        | Data isolation, auth checks                                           | â¬œ Todo       |          |
| 5. Documentation & Usage           | OpenAPI, usage.md, examples (updated for Neo4j graph expansion)         | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress| Updated for new logic |
| 6. Unit Tests                      | Mocked tests for all new endpoints (expanded for /query/graph)           | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress| Expanded for Neo4j logic |
| 7. Integration Tests               | Live tests for all new endpoints (expanded for /query/graph)             | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress| Expanded for Neo4j logic |

## Phase 2 Milestone: Delivered Functionality
- Multimodal `/query/vector` endpoint (text, image, audio, PDF, video)
- MIME-based routing to embedding/model pipelines
- Full unit and integration test coverage
- Usage and OpenAPI documentation with examples
- Backwards compatibility with legacy JSON requests

---

## Next Phase: Planning
- GraphRAG Query API (`/query/graph`): context, time, and semantic graph expansion
- Direct Retrieval API (`/query/{doc_id}`): fetch by document ID
- Security & Multi-Tenancy: data isolation, auth
- (Add more as needed)
