# Future Phase: Enhancing Video Embedding for Multimodal RAG

## Overview

This document outlines strategies, best practices, and state-of-the-art approaches for robust video embedding in the agentic multimodal RAG pipeline. It is intended as a reference for a future phase focused on advanced video search and retrieval.

## 1. Frame-Based Embedding (Practical Baseline)
- **How it works:**
  - Extract key frames or sample frames from the video (e.g., every N seconds, scene changes, or using shot detection).
  - Use an image embedding model (e.g., Nomic Multimodal, CLIP) to embed each frame.
  - Aggregate the frame embeddings (average, max-pool, or attention-based pooling) to produce a single vector for the video or for each segment.
- **Pros:** Simple, scalable, leverages existing image models.
- **Cons:** Ignores temporal dynamics (motion, sequence).
- **Recommended Libraries:** `opencv-python`, `scenedetect`, `torchvision`, `PIL`.

## 2. Multimodal Embedding (Vision + Audio)
- **How it works:**
  - Extract both frames and audio tracks.
  - Embed frames as above; embed audio using models like Whisper or Wav2Vec.
  - Concatenate or fuse the embeddings (simple concat, learned fusion, or cross-modal transformers).
- **Pros:** Captures both visual and auditory information.
- **Cons:** More complex, requires careful fusion.

## 3. Video-Specific Embedding Models (State-of-the-Art)
- **How it works:**
  - Use models trained specifically for video understanding, which process sequences of frames and (optionally) audio.
  - Examples:
    - **VideoCLIP**: Extends CLIP to video by aligning video and text.
    - **X-CLIP, ViViT, TimeSformer, VideoMAE, InternVideo, BEiT-3, etc.**: Transformer-based models for video.
    - **OpenAI Sora (2024)**: Multimodal video generation/understanding (not open source yet).
- **Pros:** Captures temporal dynamics, motion, and context.
- **Cons:** Requires significant compute and storage; some models are not open source.
- **Open Source Models:**
  - [VideoCLIP (Microsoft)](https://github.com/microsoft/VideoCLIP)
  - [X-CLIP](https://github.com/microsoft/VideoX)
  - [TimeSformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/TimeSformer)
  - [VideoMAE](https://github.com/MCG-NJU/VideoMAE)
  - [InternVideo](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVideo)

## 4. Temporal Chunking and Indexing
- **How it works:**
  - Split video into temporal segments (e.g., 5s, 10s, or per scene).
  - Embed each segment separately and index in Milvus.
  - Enables fine-grained search (e.g., "find the moment where X happens").
- **Pros:** More precise retrieval, enables timeline-based search.
- **Cons:** Increases index size and complexity.

---

## 5. Textual Metadata and ASR
- **How it works:**
  - Extract subtitles, closed captions, or use ASR (Whisper) to transcribe speech.
  - Embed the transcript using the text pipeline and combine with visual embeddings.
- **Pros:** Great for videos with lots of speech or on-screen text; enables text-based search.
- **Cons:** Not all videos have useful audio/text.

---

## 6. Best Practices for Production
- **Async Processing:** Video processing is compute-intensive; use async/background jobs for extraction and embedding.
- **Caching:** Cache extracted frames and embeddings to avoid recomputation.
- **Configurable Granularity:** Allow users to choose between whole-video, scene, or segment-level search.
- **Hybrid Search:** Combine vector search with metadata filters (e.g., duration, speaker, scene type).
- **User Feedback Loop:** Allow users to refine or annotate search results to improve relevance.

## 7. Practical Next Steps
1. **Frame Extraction:** Use OpenCV to extract N frames per video.
2. **Image Embedding:** Use the existing Nomic/CLIP pipeline on each frame.
3. **Aggregation:** Average or max-pool the frame embeddings.
4. **(Optional) Audio Embedding:** Use Whisper to embed the audio track.
5. **(Optional) Explore VideoCLIP or TimeSformer for advanced use cases.**
